# Horse Run

This is a simple game made for my college course assignment (CIS400)  
It is a console game written in Python 3  
Expected to be able to run on both Windows and Linux  

If it does not work, please create an issue in the repository

Control is Easy: Press Space to jump, Press Q to quit

The game idea is inspired from the dinosaur game in Chrome  
System specific codes (like move cursor, hide cursor) are learnt from the Internet  
All game logics and all other codes are written by myself
